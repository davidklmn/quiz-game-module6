Javascript Quiz Game
<br>
<b>Please note I am using logic2.js file.</b>

## Description

In this challenge I created a quiz game using JavaScript.
I used various functions to start the quiz, get new questions, clear the answered questions and load the next one. Also built a timer which reaches 0 ends the game. Using localStorage storing the users initials and highscore.

This homework was very challenging and needed to backtrack and research to get it to work. First try I started to confuse myself so I decided to give it a second go a day after, hence why i have 2 logic files (I wanted to keep my first trial). By the end I started to understand more and more of the logic.
